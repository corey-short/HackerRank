####Problem Statement
You are given an integer <b>N</b>. Print the factorial of this number.

###N!=N×(N−1)×(N−2)×⋯×3×2×1

Note: Factorials of <b>N>20</b> can't be stored even in a <b>64−bit</b> long long variable. Big integers must be used for such calculations. Languages like Java, Python, Ruby etc. can handle big integers but we need to write additional code in C/C++ to handle such large values.

We recommend solving this challenge using BigIntegers.

####Input Format
Input consists of a single integer <b>N</b>.

####Constraints
###1≤N≤100

####Output Format
Output the factorial of <b>N</b>.

#####Sample Input
25
#####Sample Output
15511210043330985984000000
